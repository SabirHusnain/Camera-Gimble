# Project Description: Camera Gimbal with MPU6050 and Arduino Nano

The Camera Gimbal project presents a stabilizing mechanism for cameras using an MPU6050 sensor and servo motors controlled by an Arduino Nano. The mechanical structure of the gimbal is constructed using aluminum, providing a sturdy and lightweight body to support the camera. The gimbal system actively compensates for movement and vibrations, ensuring smooth and stable footage capture.

## Key Features

1. Stabilization: The camera gimbal utilizes an MPU6050 sensor to detect angular changes and movements. The sensor provides data about the camera's orientation, allowing the gimbal to actively adjust the position of the camera in real-time.

2. Servo Motor Control: Servo motors are used to control the movement of the camera gimbal. The Arduino Nano board interfaces with the MPU6050 sensor and calculates the required adjustments. It then sends the appropriate signals to the servo motors, allowing precise control over the camera's positioning.

3. Aluminum Mechanical Structure: The mechanical structure of the camera gimbal is constructed using aluminum, offering a balance between strength and weight. The aluminum material provides rigidity and stability to the gimbal, ensuring smooth movements while keeping the overall weight of the gimbal system manageable.

4. Smooth and Stable Footage: By actively compensating for camera movements and vibrations, the camera gimbal ensures smooth and stable footage capture. It minimizes camera shake and unwanted motions, resulting in professional-looking videos or images.

5. Arduino Nano Control: The Arduino Nano acts as the central control unit of the camera gimbal system. It processes data from the MPU6050 sensor and calculates the necessary adjustments to maintain camera stability. The Arduino Nano also offers flexibility for customization and expansion of the gimbal's features.

The Camera Gimbal project, incorporating the MPU6050 sensor, servo motors, and an Arduino Nano, provides an effective solution for stabilizing cameras. The aluminum mechanical structure enhances durability and stability, allowing for high-quality footage capture even in dynamic environments. Whether used for videography, photography, or other applications requiring stable camera movements, this camera gimbal offers a reliable tool to achieve professional results.
